    "__Instance method:__ Used to access or modify the object state. If we use instance variables inside a method, such methods are called instance methods. It must have a self parameter to refer to the current object.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Class method:__ Used to access or modify the class state. In method implementation, if we use only class variables, then such type of methods we should declare as a class method.The class method has a cls parameter which refers to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Static method:__ It is a general utility method that performs a task in isolation. Inside this method, we don’t use instance or class variable because this static method doesn’t take any parameters like self and cls. Simply, it is a method which does not have access to the class state. In other words, the method confines to itself and cannot change the properties of the class instance without any workaround.\n",
